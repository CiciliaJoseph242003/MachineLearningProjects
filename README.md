## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own directory with the following typical structure:

project-name 
1)data/ # Raw or processed datasets
2)notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for exploration and training
3) src/ # Python scripts and modules
4) models/ # Saved models (.pkl, .h5, etc.)
5) requirements.txt # List of Python dependencies
